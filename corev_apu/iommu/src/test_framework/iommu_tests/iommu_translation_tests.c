/**
 * !NOTES:
 * 
 *  -   IOMMU Initialization is performed according to the guidelines in the spec document.
 *      Some steps will be skipped in the first implementation of these tests, 
 *      such as reading the capabilities register or the fctl register, since we know its default values.
 * 
 *  -   When using wired-interrupts as IOMMU interrupt generation mechanism, 
 *      the APLIC should be programmed in the initialization phase.
 *      We will perform this step when testing interrupt generation.
 * 
 *  -   The DMA-capable device used to test the IOMMU reads a value from a given address 
 *      in memory and writes it in other position. Thus, known values must be written in memory before
 *      programming the device. In order to facilitate this process, the core MMU will be configured 
 *      in bare mode so we can write directly using physical addresses.
